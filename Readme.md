# Goal

Make a WebGL version playable at https://dereksturm263.github.io/Bubble-Game/

# Maintence

When publishing a new web build please amend the previous commit. This will clobber the previous webGL build. This should be done as otherwise this branch will quickly get bloated due to webassembly files.

# Ophans

This is an orphan branch. As described on https://gitlab.com/tortoisegit/tortoisegit/-/issues/1090
